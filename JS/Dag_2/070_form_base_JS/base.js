// now, we know that we want the address or the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) as it is called
// and there is a way to get the URL with some extra features
let currentURL = new URL(window.location.href);

// printing it will show us the extra stuff

// one of the extras is "search"
console.log(currentURL.search);
// this will cut off everything before the ? mark

// now we have the info from the form, lets get the info into a useable format

// URLSearchParams is a way to get form data like this
// its called HTTP GET method
// URLSearchParams let us get this data in a easy way.

// there is a few features that URLSearchParams has that is usefull
// the main one is "get", that lets us fetch form data based on the form name
